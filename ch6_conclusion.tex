\section{Conclusion}
% dit gaat samenvattende conclusie van ch5 en ch6 worden!! 

%conclusie is geen abstract!
In the introduction we emphasized the ease with which humans semantically
interpret a scene.  We also denoted that for a computer system this task is far
from trivial. Having completed this research we can conclude that this holds even
more.\\

In this research quite some useful semantics of an urban scene was derived: a
full 3D construction of the building and the extraction of his windows.
Although this is very little in comparison to what humans perceive, we made a
valuable start towards human-like interpretation of urban scenes.\\

The applications grow in the number of correct derived semantics. With just the
extracted 3D model and the extracted windows we can now recognize buildings,
build 3D city models, monitor building deformation and add augmented reality
to scenes.  Imagine what would be possible if we add more semantics like
house numbers, doors, trees, cars or even (your stolen?) bicycle...
