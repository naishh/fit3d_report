\title{Q}
\item Why are we so good at object/depth recognition?
\item How can we apply vision to a computer system?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\textit{Computer Vision}}
		% this is the domain which interest me the most and on which I did my research
	\end{itemize}
%These are two questions that keeps us AI people bussy
% I will answer the first one shortley and the rest of the presentation is about
% the second question

\title{Human perception}
% lets talk about how you perceived the scene of the building
\item depth cue, binocular disparity
% vingertest
% everybody raise your index finger, 
% now close your left eye and switch to see your finger hopping
% do the same with your finger further away
% the displacement is smaller

%We use two eyes and look at the sam scene from slightly diffeent angles
%We perceive two different images, if an object appears close the differenc
%displacement difference between the images is high
%this makes it possible to triangulate the distance to an abject with a high
%degree of accuracy

\begin{itemize}
\item Classify objects: feature detection
	\begin{itemize}
		\item straight lines
		\item right angles 
	\end{itemize}

\title{Skyline in urban scenes}% the method
%we use it to detect the contour of the building
\begin{itemize}
	\item Canny edge detection 
	\item Result: Binary image (edge or no edge)
	% evt computerprogrammatjuuuu
		%edge represents a high change in color 
	%\item Pre-precessing: Gaussian smoothing
	\item top sharp edge assumption\\
	\emph{"The first sharp edge (seen from top to bottom) in the image represents the skyline."}
\end{itemize}


\title{Skyline detection algorithm}% the method
\begin{itemize}
	\item The image is sliced in #w pixelcolumns
	\item Each column present #h binary edge values (edge or no edge)
	\item y-location of the first edge value is stored 
\end{itemize}



\title{Skyline detection Result}% the method
\fig{e_floriande_canny_050.eps}

\subsection{Future research}
\title{Hypothesis based skyline detection, assumption}
\emph{"The first sharp edge (seen from top to bottom) in the image represents the skyline."}
\item Example of a scene where this assumption is violated
\fig{outputSkylineSpil-Im13-thresh030.eps}

\title{Hypothesis based skyline detection, assumption}
\item Change of assumption
\emph{"The skyline is part of the first $n$ sharp edges (seen from top) (e.g.
$n=3$)}
\fig{folkert_edgeHypothesis.eps}

\title{Hypothesis based skyline detection, algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use exsisting column based approach
\item Generate $n$ hypothesis
\item classify hypothesis with additional info
	\begin{itemize}
	\item texture 
	\item color
	\item height variation 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\title{Expected result on hypothesis classification based on color}
\fig{outputSkylineSpil-Im13-thresh070.eps}

\title{Expected result on hypothesis classification based on heigth variation}
\fig{outputSkylineIm3-3-zoom.eps}
\fig{outputSkylineIm3-3-zoom-con.eps}

%todo close up skyline above sky below bricks
%todo close up skyline above sky below sky (lamp) 


%notes
%The existing column based approach could be used to generate $n$ hypotheses and we can build
%an algorithm on top of that to classify which hypothesis is right (i.e. which edge
%presents the skyline).
%
%The hypothesis classifier must gather additional information. We could
%discriminate the hypothesis for example by texture, color distributions or height
%variation. We discuss the last two.


\section{Extracting the 3D model}
\title{Overview}
%notes a skyline detection application
\begin{itemize}
\item Create (top view) 2D model of the scene using \emph{Openstreetmap}
\fig{openstreetmap}
\item Align 2D model with the scene using \emph{FIT3D toolbox}
\item Transform the 2D model to a 3D model by extending the walls
\end{itemize}

\title{Extract 2D model}
\fig{openstreetmap}

\title{Align 2D model}
\item Extract 3D point cloud using \emph{FIT3D toolbox}
% out of the scope, is explained in my thesis
