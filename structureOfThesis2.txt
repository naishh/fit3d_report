Appendix
	Hough-transform


MISC:
introduce every topic
whats the plan (in linear/logic story)
Preliminaries on (good title here, 3D reconstruction?) ??


ORDER OF WRITING:
inside out
Introduction AFTER conclusion


TO THINK OF:
Skip preliminaries and keep good appendix??
ask leo whether to put the preliminaries as appendix or not
read thesis isaac


TODO:
write something about houghlines

think of good hypothesis
that fits well with second part thesis:
extract semantics from buildings
where is the building  (part 1)
what is a door/window?
how many stories does it has


Planning:
see next.txt
