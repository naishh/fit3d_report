\section{Comments on this thesis}

Dear Frans,\\

I write this in English so Isaac can also read it.\\
You are looking at an update of my thesis. Isaac read it and gave me feedback. His feedback and all feedback you gave me earlier are incorporated except for:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item the test on different datasets
Because the 3D model isn't ready at the time of writing, 
I only used different datasets at the skyline detector.
\item parametervalues Houghline
(I'll do this on the end)
\item large introduction
In 'how to write a thesis' they advice to write the introduction at the end
(when all chapters are finished) so I wait with this chapter.
\end{itemize}

Questions for you:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Should I include result images of the related work?
\item My new method of line-wall association (section \ref{sec:lwa}) is much better and
more intuitive then my old method (section \ref{sec:oldmethodlwa}). Therefor I am considering to discard the old method. However, I could also keep the old method and use it as
a test against the new one. What is your advice about this?\\
\item Could you give me feedback about the level of detail, where do I go in to much and where is more detail desired?\\
\item Isaac told me to make the future work section shorter, do you agree
with this? And if so could you tell me which part I should drop?
Furthermore my discussion section is very short, I think it is best to add more discussion when the other datasets and results are ready. What do you think?\\
\item I have tried to write down some formulas and symbols but didn't do it everywhere and didn't do it consistently. Would you give me feedback where to put (more) formulas or symbols and where to discard them?\\
\item I have troubles with putting my work of chapter 3 in context with the work of others because I can't find any related work about this (specific) subject.  How do I deal with that?\\
\item I have difficulties with deciding wheter to put a text in the preliminaries, chapter or in an appendix. Could you give me feedback about this?
\end{itemize}

Please let me know when the feedback is done and let's make an appointment to discuss it. I think Isaacs presence will not be necesarry, right Isaac?\\
I am available most of the days. Please let me know when you are available.\\

Thanks in advance for reading my thesis chapter and giving me useful feedback.\\

Kind regards,\\
