%% In the standard field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the main goal is to find
%% an optimal solution for a given problem, which often requires a form of
%% adaptation or learning. This in contrast to AI in (commercial) video games,
%% where the goal is to provide a rich gaming experience for the end user.
%% Providing this experience requires a careful balance between control by the
%% developers and autonomous, learning AI.
The main goal of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in commercial video games is to
provide a rich gaming experience for the end user. Providing this experience
requires a careful balance between encoding prior knowledge, control by
developers and autonomous, learning AI. 

This thesis proposes a method that maintains a balance between these three
objectives. The method proposed is a novel combination of Hierarchical Task
Network (HTN) planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The HTN provides the
structure to encode a variety of strategies by human developers, whereas RL
allows for learning the best strategy against a fixed opponent. The method is
empirically analyzed by applying it on the strategic level of \emph{Killzone 3}
-- a first-person shooter video game. 

From the results we can conclude that the best strategy with respect to a fixed
opponent indeed is learned and when a different opponent is introduced, the
system has the ability to adapt its strategy accordingly.

This thesis is the final product of my time as intern researcher at Guerrilla.
I would like to thank my supervisors Shimon Whiteson (Assistant professor at
the University of Amsterdam) and Remco Straatman (Lead AI developer at
Guerrilla). Furthermore I would like to thank all members of the AI team at
Guerrilla for their technical support and constructive feedback and last but
not least my family for their loving support.
