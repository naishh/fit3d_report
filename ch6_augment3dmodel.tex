\section{Augmenting the 3D building estimate}
\subsection{Introduction}
From the previous section we saw how the skyline was detected and how every point on this skyline was projected on its most likely wall. (what does this mean in general)
We would like to use this information to augment the basic 3d model.

So we have as input a
- set of calibrated 2D images with a binary skyline indication
- a rough 3d model
The output is an updated 3d model.

For this an algoritm is designed which consist of several steps. 
First of all the individual skyline pixels are grouped into line segments using an approach of (TODO DAVID??OFZO) Hough.
Every line segment in 3D belongs to a specific wall which is heuristicly determined in the second step.
The third step is to combine the projected houghlinesegments which produces and estimate of the height of each wall.
In the last step this height is used to augment the rough 3d model.

%For simplicity reasons we assume that a building consists of a flat roof, note that the walls may have different heights but the roof should be flat.
%TODO cons pros of this assumption
%TODO vet goed dat ik dus mijn algo different wallheights aan kan, promoten!


%why fit lines on 2d and not in 3d
%cheaper easyer?
%we take a step back into the process (skyline detection)


\subsection{The algorithm}
\subsubsection{Houghlines}
	chainging / motivation:
	% details in appendix

	%houghlines on edge detection
	% write this chapter as last because
	% use wikipedia and my previous research for it 

	%this method can be seen as some sort of outlier removal?
	% write someting about the happy little DAMNED trees that we need to remove hehehe


\subsubsection{Houghline wall recognition}
	%decide which line segment represents which wall (heuristic)
\subsubsection{Wall height estimation}
	%calc average height of lines for each wall
	% update belonging wall




endpoints of houghlines belong to certain wall






\subsection{Results (What did I find)}
\subsection{Discussion (What do my results mean to me and why)}
\subsection{Conclusion and Future work}
The flat roof assumption could be stretched to a roof consist of two planes


%idea to think of (to detailed or not):
program and test different heuristics?
do analytic test (compare 1 and 3 analyticly)
	to much detail for something like this? or not?

Plan:
first write thesis without the heuristic part

IDEAS:
heuristic 1:
take a point in the middle and let it decide

heuristic 2:
the endpoint that lies more in the middle decides which wall we take
this can be calculated using the difference of distances to the wall corner points

heuristic 3:
take points on a houghline
make a rating that the more in a middle a point is the more evidence there is
this is because it is more away from a corner so lower change of other wall


% TODO
what to do with outliers
where to put the intersection algorithm part
for now i let it in skyline detection and refer to it
maybe later move it!
%TODO what are the mathematics
%TODO write something about complications and wat je er aan hebt
%what are the assumptions and heuristics
%use power of illustration, lots of example images! ask myself is there stil something left where I can add an illustration??
