title: Graph Theory and Mean Shift Segmentation Based Classiﬁcation of Building Facades

Most of the previous algorithms are computationally expensive and not suitable for real time applications. Because
of the requirements of real-time applications robust and fast
classiﬁcation of facades is still an open research topic
