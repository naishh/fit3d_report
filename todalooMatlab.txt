Matlab todo

camera calibration


IMAGES
skyline result on the other dataset
a better projected houghline image where the lines at the right side are
displayed better

a line comes from the camera center through de image to the building
(use openscenegraph for this)
skyline detection without the custom algo (highen contrast, gauss etc) and compair to the
custom algo

the scene from top where 5 cameras are positioned (maybe rip from
isaac paper)

MISC
Edge detection with different thresholds
and different methods


IMAGES FROM PDFS
outdoor visual... pdf
page 15


CATEGORIE would be nice:
improve quality of final image where the building is improved
an image with the skyline AND the houghlines
