Edge detection with different thresholds

IMAGES
the scene from top where 5 cameras are positioned (maybe rip from
isaac paper)
a line comes from the camera center through de image to the building
(use openscenegraph for this)

CATEGORIE would be nice:
improve quality of final image where the building is improved
an image with the skyline AND the houghlines
