\subsubsection{Situation and assumptions}
In this method we assume the wall containing the windows to be rectified.
To be more precise we assume the windows to have orthogonal sides.
Furthermore we assume the windows to be alligned.

The main idea is that we extract the alignment of the windows based on
histogramming Houghlines on projected coordinates.

histogram based approach, the idea
We introduce the concept alignment line. We define this as a horizontal or
vertical line that alignes multiple windows. In image %TODO the green dotted
green and we represent the alignment lines as two groups, horizontal (red) and
vertical (green) alignment lines. The intersection of both groups give a good
indication of the corners of the windows.

The extraction of the alignment lines consist of several steps.

First we extract the coordinates of the endpoints of the Hough transformed line
segments and store them in two groups, horizontal and vertical (Figure
\ref{fig:houghlineEndpoints}). 

We project the coordinates to the orthogonal direction of its group. This means
that the horizontal Houghlines are projected in the Y direction and the vertical
Houghlines are projected in the X direction, leaving the data in two groups of 1
dimensional coordinates.

We calculate two histograms H(orizontal) and V(ertical), containing respectively $w$
and $h$ bins where $w x h$ is the dimensions of the image.
