We build an automatic system that adds semantics to a urban scene.  
A 3D model was extracted by combining the \emph{FIT3D toolbox\cite{FIT3D}} combined with a skyline detection algorithm.
The skyline detector extracts straight line segments from the upper edges of an
image.  These are used to set the heights of the walls of the 3D model.
Next, windows are extracted by two different methods.  The first method
searches for connected horizontal and vertical edges which come from the window
frame.  The second method works on rectified facades and consist of 1) the
determination of the alignment of the windows and 2) the classification of the
windows.  The alignment and classification are based on the interpretation of
the Histogram function of a Hough transform of the edge image.  Both methods
detect at least 99\% of the windows.
