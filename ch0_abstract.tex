We build an automatic system that adds semantics to an urban scene.  
A 3D model was extracted by combining the \emph{FIT3D toolbox\cite{FIT3D}} with a skyline detection algorithm.
The skyline detector extracts straight line segments from the upper edge of an
image.  These are used to determine the wall heights of an extended 2D model extracted from
\emph{Openstreetmap\cite{Openstreetmap}}. 
Next, windows are detected by two different methods:the first method
is invariant to viewing direction and detects the windows by searching for
connected horizontal and vertical edges.

 The second method is applied on rectified facades and consist of 1) the
determination of the alignment of the windows and 2) the classification of the
windows.  The alignment and classification are based on the interpretation of
a Histogram function that contains Hough lines extracted from edges.  Both methods
detect at least 99\% of the windows.
