%%skyline detection:
%A detailed research on related work research was done.
%We introduced a novel application of skyline detection: the extraction of a
%building contour. We build an algorithm on top of a successful existing
%algorithm.  The algorithm doesn't depend on human intervention and is robust and
%accurate enough to provide a base for the next module in the system.\\
%It is interesting to denote that the skyline detector is a stand alone method and
%can be optimized individually without any knowledge of the other modules of the
%project.\\
%
%Although the outlier removal procedure is done in a separate module, it would be
%interesting (future work) to develop a skyline detector which is more robust to
%outliers.  Most of the related work is based on detecting parts that are
%classified as sky and parts that are classified as ground. The idea of detecting
%the sky and ground could be replaced by detecting the sky and a building. The
%distinctive textures of the buildings (repeating bricks) could be of great use
%for the classification.  After that, a rough building contour could be estimated
%	by using the highest building pixel for every column. In this neighborhood,
%	detailed edge detection could be done. In this way the outliers (e.g. the
%	streetlight and the tree) are filtered and no secondary outlier removal
%	procedure is needed.
