\begin{abstract}
We build an automatic system that adds semantics to a urban scene .  First we
use images taken from different angles to extract the skyline. Then we apply a
Hough transform to extract the contour of a building. Next we use projective
geometry to extract a 3D model of the building. Finally two methods of window
detection are presented, the first is based on cornerfeatures and the second is
based on Histograms of Houghlines.  The product is a 3D annotated scene where the
building and windows are labeled.\\
