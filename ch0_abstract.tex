We build an automatic system that adds semantics to an urban scene.  
A 3D model was extracted by combining the \emph{FIT3D toolbox\cite{FIT3D}} with a skyline detection algorithm.
The skyline detector extracts straight line segments from the upper edge of an
image.  These are used to determine the wall heights of an extended 2D model extracted from
\emph{Openstreetmap\cite{Openstreetmap}}. 
Next, windows are extracted by two different methods.  The first method
searches for connected horizontal and vertical edges which come from the window
frame.  The second method works on rectified facades and consist of 1) the
determination of the alignment of the windows and 2) the classification of the
windows.  The alignment and classification are based on the interpretation of
the Histogram function of a Hough transform of the edge image.  Both methods
detect at least 99\% of the windows.
