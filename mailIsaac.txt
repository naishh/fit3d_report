Dear Isaac,

I want to finish my thesis within 3 months from now.
This means that I want to end the practical part within 2 months. For some
personal reasons I am very serious about this and I have the motivation and time
to work really hard to reach this goal. 

At this moment I have the feeling you don't have enough time for me to acquire
this target. I'll discuss some solutions to this problem. Furthermore I
ask you to think of ideas and solutions about this yourself.

-I think it's easier to put more time on the project if you reserve the time.
-We could meet, from now on, one scheduled day a week (just 1 hour would be enough).
-I can come to wherever you are (TNO?), that saves you traveling time.
-You reserve and schedule 15min time at the half of the week to answer my e-mail.
-We discuss problems over the phone where possible (faster then typing
long mails and allows interaction).
-We could finish the current part together and I can find (or you can help me find)
somebody else to support me with the second part (door/window detection).

Please let me know what you think of this. And let me know when you can meet.

Kind regards,

Tjerk
